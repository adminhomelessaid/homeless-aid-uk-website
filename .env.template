# Homeless Aid UK - Outreach Attendance System Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local in Vercel or set these in your deployment environment

# ===================================
# AUTHENTICATION - Lead Volunteers
# ===================================
# Add multiple lead volunteers by incrementing the number
# Format: OUTREACH_USERNAME_[number], OUTREACH_PASSWORD_[number], OUTREACH_NAME_[number]

# Lead Volunteer 1 - Ben Bolton
OUTREACH_USERNAME_1=ben_bolton
OUTREACH_PASSWORD_1=your_secure_password_here
OUTREACH_NAME_1=Ben Ahern

# Lead Volunteer 2 - Example
# OUTREACH_USERNAME_2=jane_manchester
# OUTREACH_PASSWORD_2=another_secure_password
# OUTREACH_NAME_2=Jane Smith

# Lead Volunteer 3 - Example
# OUTREACH_USERNAME_3=john_liverpool
# OUTREACH_PASSWORD_3=yet_another_secure_password
# OUTREACH_NAME_3=John Doe

# Add more volunteers as needed following the same pattern...

# ===================================
# JWT AUTHENTICATION
# ===================================
# Secret key for signing JWT tokens - MUST be changed in production!
# Generate a secure random string (at least 32 characters)
# Example command to generate: openssl rand -base64 32
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here_change_in_production

# ===================================
# EMAIL CONFIGURATION (Existing)

RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_USER=info@homelessaid.co.uk

# ===================================
# DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ===================================
# 1. In Vercel Dashboard:
#    - Go to Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Add each variable above with appropriate values
#    - Use strong, unique passwords for each volunteer
#    - Generate a cryptographically secure JWT_SECRET
#
# 2. Security Best Practices:
#    - Never commit actual passwords to git
#    - Use different passwords for each volunteer
#    - Rotate passwords regularly (every 3-6 months)
#    - Use password managers to generate/store passwords
#    - JWT_SECRET should be at least 256 bits (32+ characters)
#
# 3. Password Requirements:
#    - Minimum 12 characters
#    - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
#    - No common dictionary words
#    - Unique per volunteer
#
# 4. Adding New Volunteers:
#    - Follow the numbering pattern (OUTREACH_USERNAME_4, etc.)
#    - Ensure NAME matches the volunteer's actual name
#    - Test login after adding new credentials
#
# 5. Monitoring:
#    - Check Vercel function logs for failed login attempts
#    - Review attendance logs regularly for anomalies
#    - Monitor for unusual access patterns
